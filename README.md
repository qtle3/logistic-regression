# Social Network Ads Classification using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the use of **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a user on a social network will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary. Using a dataset that includes these features, the Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated, with visualizations for both the training and test set results.

## Dataset

The dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`) contains user information from a social network, including:
- **Age**
- **Estimated Salary**
- **Purchased (Target Variable)** - Whether the user purchased the product (1) or did not (0).
